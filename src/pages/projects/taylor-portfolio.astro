projectSub="Portfolio Website using AstroJS"
projectText=`I worked with Taylor Violet Ross to design and develop a modern, responsive portfolio website to showcase
             her creative and academic work. The site was built using Astro.build, a fast static site framework that 
             allowed me to create clean and lightweight pages with minimal load times. I handled the full 
             front-end build; structuring the layout, organizing content sections, optimizing images, and 
             ensuring consistent styling across all pages. The site was deployed on Azure Static Web Apps, 
             which provided reliable hosting, and automatic builds for quick updates. 
             My goal was to create a professional online presence that was visually appealing, easy to navigate, 
             and able to highlight Taylor’s work effectively on both desktop and mobile.`
projectText2=`A key part of the project involved enhancing the website’s SEO and performance to help Taylor increase visibility and reach a wider audience. I implemented SEO best practices, including optimized metadata, descriptive titles, structured headings, image alt-text, and clean URLs for better indexing. I also improved page performance by compressing assets, lazy-loading media, minimizing JavaScript, and leveraging Astro’s built-in optimization features. Additionally, I focused on accessibility by ensuring proper semantic HTML, readable contrast ratios, and keyboard-friendly navigation. These improvements created a fast, search-friendly website that ranks more effectively on Google and provides a smoother experience for visitors across devices.`
