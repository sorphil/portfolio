projectText=`As part of supporting Taylor Violet Ross’s thesis, I assisted with the technical analysis by 
            aggregating and processing data using Python. After generating similarity scores through AWS Rekognition and 
            CompreFace, I helped consolidate the outputs into structured datasets, cleaning and organizing 
            the results to ensure consistency. I used Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to 
            visualize these similarity scores, creating charts that highlighted patterns and discrepancies between 
            the different craniofacial approximation outputs. These visualizations helped Taylor clearly illustrate 
            how different reconstruction approaches affected facial similarity, giving her a more data-driven 
            foundation for her conclusions.`
projectText2=`I also supported Taylor by reviewing and editing sections of her written thesis, ensuring that the technical
             findings were presented clearly and accurately. This included refining explanations of the analysis process,
              strengthening descriptions of the visualized results, and improving the overall clarity and flow of the 
              research narrative. By helping integrate the visual data, similarity metrics, and methodological 
              discussion, I contributed to making her final submission more coherent, accessible, and academically
               polished.`
