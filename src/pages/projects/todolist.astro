projectTitle="To-Do List Web Application"
projectSub="Full-Stack Task Management with Django REST and Vanilla JavaScript"
projectText=`I built a to-do list web application using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the frontend, paired with Django REST framework on the backend to manage data and user authentication. This project allowed me to practice creating a RESTful API, handling session management securely, and enabling CRUD operations to maintain task lists. I hosted the backend using PythonAnywhere, which helped me understand deploying and maintaining web services in a cloud environment.`
projectText2=`On the frontend, I designed a clean, user-friendly interface that dynamically interacts with the backend API to display, add, edit, and delete tasks in real-time. I implemented responsive design principles to ensure usability on both desktop and mobile devices. This project enhanced my skills in asynchronous JavaScript, API consumption, and UI/UX best practices.`
