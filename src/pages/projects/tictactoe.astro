projectTitle=" Tic-Tac-Toe Application"
projectSub="Vanilla JavaScript Game with Human and AI Opponents"
projectText=`I created a Tic-Tac-Toe game using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, supporting both human-vs-human and human-vs-AI modes. The AI opponent uses the MinMax algorithm to provide a challenging experience by making optimal moves. Building this project helped me strengthen my understanding of game logic, recursion, and algorithmic thinking, while keeping the code modular and maintainable.`
projectText2=`I developed an intuitive and responsive UI with clear visual feedback to make gameplay engaging and accessible. The application manages game state seamlessly, updates the board in real-time, and handles edge cases such as draws or invalid moves. This project sharpened my skills in DOM manipulation and event handling, emphasizing a smooth and enjoyable user experience.`
